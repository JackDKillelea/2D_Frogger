# 2D_Frogger
This is my attempt at recreating Frogger in Unity using C#. I have put my own twist on it though, it is no longer frogger and more "wizarder", if you will.


This is my variant of the retro game Frogger. I thought it to be one step up from Pong and get me used to the Unity Engine even more. I managed to create this with relative, after Pong I had got used to how Unity works and got my head around the basics but I feel like this built on them basics.

In this I grabbed a free set of assets (which were in one huge sprite sheet) and cut them all down to size using Unity's built in functions. This was easier than expected and also made working with the movement and enemy collisions fairly easy.

In this game you play as a wizard and have to get to the end (like the retro game but just with a wizard!).

If you get hit by a moving enemy you are presented with a game over screen, this will be active for 2 seconds and then the game will reset.

There are obstacles that you are unable to walk though.

The points increase as you move high and higher, if you move back and then up again this will not count as a point. The level scaling system works in the same way, once you hit the top your character will reset, the game will get 20% harder and you will have to get to the top once more.


This was made in the Unity Engine and programmed in C#.
